     <p style="text-align:justify;">I love <i>computer</i>. And I love everything about them. Sometimes I may be stressed, by doing all that <i>programming codes</i> and all. But I could never stop doing that. Like if that was my only way. Thus I understood that, one of my passion is <i>coding, programming and all</i>. Then I started attending each and every <i>webinar</i> and <i>competitions</i>. I lost in many <i>competitions</i>, but I never <i>quit</i>. So I'm after it. Thus I reached this <strong>Fi-Pro Challenge</strong>.</p>
