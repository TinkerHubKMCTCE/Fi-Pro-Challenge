        <h3>Why I joined Fi-Pro Challenge? </h3>
        <p>I was pretty excited when I came to know about this Fi-Pro Challenge. Eventhough I am Mechanical Engineering Student, I was interested to learn something new and  useful .  </p>
        <p>As soon as I saw the poster of this program, no second thoughts came to my mind. I registered for the program right then. I did my higher secondary schooling in computer    </p>
        <p>science department and have basic knowledge in html , java , etc... So I thought of brushing up my knowledge and learn Web-Development. Why should I miss such an oppurtunity</p>
        <P>of learning something new that too absolutely free.</P>
